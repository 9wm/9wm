Thanks to Rob Pike for writing the original 8-1/2 program (and
before that, mux) which inspired the writing of 9wm.

Thanks to John Mackin, whose gwm "wool code" for emulating mux
was also an inspiration: I used it (and hacked it) until I got
too frustrated with gwm's large memory requirements and lack of
speed (sorry Colas!), and decided to write a dedicated program.

Thanks to Matthew Farrow for writing 9term.

A big thanks to Dave Edmondson for adding support for
multi-screen displays.

The following people helped beta test 9wm:

* John Mackin
* Noel Hunt
* Fred Curtis
* James Matthew Farrow
* Danny Yee
* Arnold Robbins
